## Simple Admin Dashboard

Admin Dashboard has been built with: HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/MYSQL

This is a very simple, clean front-end design to display data sets provided to us for my University Project. It integrates with a basic back-end system connecting the database to the graph visualization libraries used and account actions.

Interested in having something similar to this made for your own project or something else developed, get in contact! I'm a University student with a lot of spare time and am looking forward to working on some unique projects.
